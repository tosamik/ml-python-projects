Ships sailing between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean had to, and still have to, sail around the southern coast of Singapore. Over the centuries, control over the Singapore Straits was thus viewed as essential for the continued prosperity of the various maritime trading powers. In the early 17th century, the Singapore Straits was the setting for numerous confrontations between the established Portuguese power and the rising Dutch power. The Portuguese had been in the region since the beginning of the 16th century, having taken control of the sultanate of Melaka in 1511 as well as acquiring Macao, a small foothold off mainland China, in 1557. In the 17th century, the Dutch were a rising maritime trading power out to displace the Portuguese in the region.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","na","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2014-07-14_095636.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/2dbdfae5-8e45-48da-87e0-5e8436a7ff44?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/2dbdfae5-8e45-48da-87e0-5e8436a7ff44?s=SM"

Private Chinese-medium schools also offered art education through courses run by professional artists. After Singapore attained self-government in 1959, art and music were regarded as non-core subjects and often taught outside of regular school hours. By the early 1980s, both subjects received greater attention from the government because the emphasis of the education system had shifted from industrial and technological training towards a broad-based education aimed at the holistic development of youths. To nurture students’ talent in art and music, the Music Elective Programme (MEP) was introduced in 1982, followed by the Art Elective Programme (AEP) in 1984. During the 21st century, the number of specialised arts institutions in Singapore increased while arts education was also enhanced in order to train talents to fill jobs in the arts sector. The Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) and Enhanced Music Programme (EMP) were introduced in 2011 to provide more opportunities for artistically and musically inclined secondary school students to develop their talent.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Sim, Cheryl","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-11_144623.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/bcd61a84-e305-4a76-accd-b3fa3fc08124?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/bcd61a84-e305-4a76-accd-b3fa3fc08124?s=SM"

Besides being a hotspot for local food such as chicken rice and bak kut teh (pork rib soup), present-day Balestier is also associated with its ubiquitous lighting shops.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Ng, Sheere","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-05-26_131044.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/827b9d67-857a-4a8e-bd8f-acd85e1915ab?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/827b9d67-857a-4a8e-bd8f-acd85e1915ab?s=SM"

The opening up of the Suez Canal in 1869, technical innovation of steamships and more significantly, the signing of the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale treaty in 1904 made it lucrative for French foreign companies to conduct commercial activities in Singapore.

The art of paan or betel chewing dates back to the pre-Vedic Saivite Harappan empire, and the activity is also known as makan sireh in Malaysia and Singapore. It requires three different plants used in combination: the betel nut which is the seed of the areca palm, the betel leaf which comes from the pan plant, and lime. The leaf is first daubed with lime paste and topped with thin slices of the nut before it is folded or rolled into a bite-size quid. It acts as a mouth freshener, helps digestion and creates a sense of euphoria almost like chocolate does. A betel chewer is recognised by the red staining of the mouth, gum, teeth and lips. Generating a large amount of saliva, the excess juices are spat out. These little morsels are sold on the streets or market. In traditional Indian households, a good host would offer a silver tray piled with a pyramid of paan after a sumptuous meal. The chewing of betel leaf (vettilai in Tamil) is more popular among the South Indians.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 21 KB, 3 p..","eng","na","Suchitthra Vasu","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_883_2004-12-17.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/e6f4151a-aef8-4d61-b509-f54cd9049c71?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/e6f4151a-aef8-4d61-b509-f54cd9049c71?s=SM"

The policy entails an emphasis on using English and the mother tongue languages, particularly that of the three main ethnic groups: Mandarin for the Chinese, Malay for the Malay community and Tamil for the Indians. English was to become Singapore’s working language, while the mother tongue would serve to strengthen an individual’s values and sense of cultural belonging. The bilingualism policy has been implemented primarily through the education system, which requires students to study the English language and their respective mother tongues. In addition, annual campaigns are held to promote the learning and speaking of mother tongue languages as well as to encourage the use of grammatically correct English among Singaporeans.

By the 1970s, Boon Lay was also home to resettled villagers from Tuas and other parts of Jurong whose lands had been acquired for industrial development. With a range of amenities to meet the daily needs of its residents and those from nearby estates, Boon Lay had become an important hub in Jurong by the 1980s.

Six months later, the deadline was brought forward to 1971. The sudden pull-out of British forces presented serious problems to Singapore’s defence and economic security. At the time, the Singapore Armed Forces was in its infancy, and the British military bases were contributing over 20 percent to Singapore’s gross national product. To counter these problems, Singapore embarked on a rapid industrialisation programme, tightened its labour laws to attract foreign investments, strengthened its defence through military cooperation with other countries, and tripled its military spending. By the deadline, Singapore had achieved strong economic growth and nearly full employment. Most of the British troops had moved out of Singapore by October 1971, leaving a token number behind. It was five years later when the last of the British troops left Singapore.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 23 KB, 2 p..","eng","na","Marsita Omar","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1001_2009-02-10.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/eb6f9fc3-51e8-4b19-b69c-a56416fbf76a?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/eb6f9fc3-51e8-4b19-b69c-a56416fbf76a?s=SM"

Cricket was particularly popular while other sports such as hockey, tennis and soccer were also promoted. The club has produced many outstanding sports teams since the 1920s, and several well-known cricket and hockey players in Malaya and Singapore had played with the club. Although the clubhouse was destroyed during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942–45), it was rebuilt after the war. Over the years, several renovations were carried out to the clubhouse, and new services introduced by the club to reach out to more members.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 15 KB, 3 p..","eng","na","Conceicao, Jeanne Louise","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1518_2009-05-11.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/62034db2-99b3-4d72-b574-1b8ebd3b18b9?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/62034db2-99b3-4d72-b574-1b8ebd3b18b9?s=SM"

The two rows of seven holes are designated as “houses” in the “village” (kampong) while the last two larger holes serve as “storehouses”, although there are variations. Seeds are placed in each hole, and then redistributed according to the rules of the game. The objective is to gain as many seeds in one’s storehouse as possible.

The week was also a way to increase public awareness of crime prevention measures.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","na","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2014-05-12_134845.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/3872a091-254d-46f6-8898-d599400aee4e?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/3872a091-254d-46f6-8898-d599400aee4e?s=SM"

The constitutional safeguards came into effect in 1991 but were invoked for the first time only in January 2009, when the government sought to use past reserves to fund special Budget measures to mitigate the effects of the looming recession.

In 2004, the Integrated Programme (IP) was introduced to enable academically strong secondary school students to proceed to junior colleges without sitting for the GCE O-level examination.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Sim, Cheryl","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-06-24_110607.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/d271348a-af13-4829-8bdc-5b99bdc524fb?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/d271348a-af13-4829-8bdc-5b99bdc524fb?s=SM"

The task of developing Jurong was initially undertaken by the Economic and Development Board, but the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was founded in 1968 to oversee the continued industrialisation and management of the estate.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 18 KB, 3 p..","eng","na","Kiong, Jenny","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1076_2010-05-14.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/ea7f0e25-22c4-4db0-acfd-723c87d73679?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/ea7f0e25-22c4-4db0-acfd-723c87d73679?s=SM"

The emergency lasted from 1948 to 1960, resulting in clashes between the armed forces of the Commonwealth and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military arm of the CPM.

First unveiled on 15 September 1972, this statue is now located at the new Merlion Park, adjacent to One Fullerton at the Marina Bay waterfront. As a symbol representing Singapore, the Merlion features prominently in tourist souvenirs sold locally.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 19 KB, 2 p..","eng","na","Yong Chun Yuan","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_938_2004-12-27.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/f9c0fd6c-acfa-4eb0-8585-2aa155c1d74d?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/f9c0fd6c-acfa-4eb0-8585-2aa155c1d74d?s=SM"

Recognising its strategic importance, the government has been building up the national reserves over the last few decades. To protect this nest egg from potential misuse, the government needs the consent of the president before it can draw on past reserves. In October 2008, the president’s approval was sought for a S$150-billion guarantee on all local bank deposits to be backed by past reserves. Then in January 2009, for the first time in the history of the elected presidency, former President S. R.

In addition, the drive aimed to double the deposits in the bank to S$100 million. The government saw domestic savings as a source of funds for investment that would bring about greater prosperity and economic growth for Singapore. The NSSC enabled students to save money by depositing cash or by purchasing 10-cent postage stamps that were then pasted onto stamp cards printed with squares. Each card could hold up to S$2 worth of stamps. When completed, the stamp cards were handed to the bank as a form of deposit. In addition, secondary one students who had a minimum balance of $5 in their POSB accounts were given a S$5 cash gift by the government. However, the combined sum of S$10 could only be withdrawn from the bank after a minimum period of five years.

In the 1960s and ’70s, changes to the PSLE system were mainly concerned with providing alternative educational pathways to pupils who failed the examination. In the ’80s and ’90s, the focus shifted towards fine-tuning the PSLE grading system so that pupils would enter the most appropriate secondary-level academic stream. From the 2000s onwards, the PSLE framework was further tweaked to de-emphasise competition and encourage the holistic development of children. In August 2005, an overseas version of the PSLE was launched.

This pursuit intensified well into the 1980s with efforts directed by the Productivity Movement. In the 1990s, the campaign focused on quality, and efforts were guided by the Productivity 2000 report. The achievements of productivity efforts in the 1980s can be seen at a macro level, where the rate of productivity growth was a proxy measure of how much the Productivity Movement contributed to the economy. During the period from 1981 to 1995, 60 percent of Singapore’s average economic growth of 7.6 percent came from productivity growth, which averaged 4.5 percent. In terms of the public’s attitude towards productivity, 93 percent of the workforce wanted the campaign to continue.

Despite the introduction of new regulation banning the use of certain types of fireworks, the problem of fires caused by fireworks remained. This prompted the government to introduce a series of stricter laws to tackle the issue. A total ban on the use of fireworks in Singapore was put in place when the Dangerous Fireworks Act came into operation on 1 August 1972. While the ban remains, the authorities have in recent years granted permission for fireworks to be used at certain events where appropriate safety precautions have been adopted.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Singapore.

His link to the pre-1819 history of Singapore is his founding of a settlement called Singapura on the island Temasek sometime in 1299 (r. 1299–1347). The sighting of a lion by Sang Utama is often told to explain the renaming of Temasek to Singapura (“City of the Sea Lion” in Sanskrit). On founding Singapura, Sang Utama assumed the title of Sri Tri Buana (“Lord of Three Worlds” in Sanskrit). Sang Utama’s descendants ruled Singapore until the reign of Iskandar Shah, the fifth ruler of Singapore, who was driven out by the Majapahit (Javanese) forces and later founded the kingdom of Malacca. Thus the lineage of Malacca kings could be traced to Sang Nila Utama and all the way to the powerful Srivijaya.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 14 KB, 2 p..","eng","na","NorAfidah Abd Rahman","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_93_2005-01-26.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/7dc04ff9-f9fb-44ba-867e-8b714f87b324?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/7dc04ff9-f9fb-44ba-867e-8b714f87b324?s=SM"

There were at least seven versions of this text.Sejarah Melayu is also one of the first Malay works scholars studied. It captured scholars’ attention because of its refined language and depiction of medieval Malay society. The work contains essentially tales and anecdotes of the past. It is considered a great literary work which gives a vivid picture of past events. As Sejarah Melayu was intended for recitation, the writer’s skill is seen in a “simple, lucid and clear style” deemed “exemplary for Malay court prose”. Sejarah Melayu is important to Singapore because it includes the tale of how Singapore got its name. In addition, the first few chapters of Sejarah Melayu suggest that Singapore has been significant in the Malay world since the 13th century.   It has been argued that Sejarah Melayu developed as stories were added to a list of kings titled Sulalat al-Salatin (Genealogy of Kings). The first Jawi text of Sejarah Melayu in print was published in Singapore and edited by Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munshi (Munsyi) in c.1840  for the use of those who wished to learn the correct form of Malay. Over the following 150 years, Sejarah Melayu was published many times in manuscripts, printed text and translations. It has also been partially or completely translated in languages such as English, Dutch, French and Chinese.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Faridah Ibrahim","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-05-08_152858.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/3d723922-e9a4-459d-aa74-633e359590c8?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/3d723922-e9a4-459d-aa74-633e359590c8?s=SM"

During World War II, the airbase came under the control of the Japanese army, but reverted to British control from 1946 until the withdrawal of British forces from Singapore in 1971. Thereafter, the eastern end of the camp was handed over to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and functioned as a military facility with restricted access, while the western side was used by commercial aircraft and accessible to the public. The personal quarters of former RAF personnel were leased out as civilian residences and became highly sought after. In 2006, a portion of the camp was redeveloped as part of the Seletar Aerospace Park project led by the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC).

From the mid-1960s onwards, coastal land reclamation works in the area saw the last fishing villages being cleared to make way for further urban development.

The founding of modern Singapore by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1819 brought economic opportunities to this same spot, attracting thousands of immigrants.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 15 KB, 1 p..","eng","na","CorneliusTakahama, Vernon","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_498_2004-12-27.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/b821c72a-9035-49e8-bcb7-a95bbd9443c9?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/b821c72a-9035-49e8-bcb7-a95bbd9443c9?s=SM"

A total of 10 primary SAP schools were introduced in 1989 to meet the same objective. In 1992, the number of primary SAP schools was increased to 15. With the rise of the Chinese economy, the Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) was established in 2005 in three SAP schools to nurture the best bilingual students into bicultural professionals who could effectively engage with China. A fourth SAP school was added to the programme in 2007.

In the 1960s, tea dances organised by clubs became the centre of the rock ’n’ roll culture in Singapore. Such tea dances eventually died out due to a clampdown by the authorities in response to frequent brawls occurring at these events. In the mid-1980s, the government revived tea dances to matchmake young Singaporeans, and discotheques subsequently organised tea dances on weekend afternoons for teenagers. This trend waned as well when the authorities deemed the activity to be a bad influence on youths, which led to a ban on those under the age of 16 from attending.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Ng, Sheere","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-03-14_133541.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/471cb42a-9533-4ea8-85f2-f8a4c8dc3353?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/471cb42a-9533-4ea8-85f2-f8a4c8dc3353?s=SM"

Technical and vocational education gained importance following the end of the Second World War when industrialisation created a demand for skilled workers. After attaining independence, it became a matter of national survival for Singapore to rapidly develop export-oriented manufacturing as a means to generate employment and economic growth. Education policy thus emphasised the teaching and learning of technical and vocational subjects in line with the needs of industrialisation. As the economy evolved over the subsequent decades towards higher-value-added, knowledge-based industries, technical and vocational education was likewise upgraded to ensure the quality and competitiveness of the Singapore workforce.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Loo, Janice","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-06-14_155946.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/5d76abd9-eab3-45e0-975c-f131db7c4fc1?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/5d76abd9-eab3-45e0-975c-f131db7c4fc1?s=SM"

It is probably the single most important public rite observed by the community every year between January 14 and February 14. Most Hindu festivals fall either on full moon day (Punarpusam) or on new-moon day (Amavasi). “Thai Pusam” occurs on the full moon day in the Tamil month “Thai” (January–February). Thaipusam is actually derived from Thai which means “10th”, and Pusam meaning “when the moon is at its brightest”. It is thus celebrated in the month of “Thai” (10th month according to the Tamil Almanac) on the day when the moon passes through the star “Pusam”. Thaipusam is a day of prayers and penance. Dedicated to Lord Subramaniam, also known as Lord Murugan, a major South Indian god, the deity of youth, power and virtue, this festival is a time for repentance for devotees with celebrations carried out mainly at the temple.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 12 KB, 2 p..","eng","na","Tan, Bonny","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_760_2004-12-27.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/deea4c72-513b-4f08-95a7-3f41b5a0eff0?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/deea4c72-513b-4f08-95a7-3f41b5a0eff0?s=SM"

Utusan Melayu was established not to rival other newspapers but to serve the bangsa, agama (“religion”) and watan (“country” or “birthplace”) of Malays. Yusof bin Ishak, who later became Singapore’s first’s Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara (“Head of State”) and subsequently president, was one of the newpaper’s prime movers.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 18 KB, 3 p..","eng","na","Chia, Joshua Yeong Jia","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1088_2007-06-12.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/02769d88-cba6-4ce0-879b-6f435dca15de?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/02769d88-cba6-4ce0-879b-6f435dca15de?s=SM"

The white paper proposed the introduction of bilingual education in Chinese schools in exchange for increased financial aid to the schools. The scheme was designed to bring Chinese schools into the mainstream of the English-medium education system by taking advantage of the precarious financial position that most Chinese schools were in at the time. To survive, many Chinese-medium schools had to charge fairly high fees, teachers were poorly paid, and working conditions less than ideal. Chinese schools getting government grants-in-aid would have to include not only the teaching of English but also have courses such as mathematics and science taught in English.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","Lim, Tin Seng","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2014-07-07_134145.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/904709fe-cc4f-4255-aaf6-522fbf4b7da6?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/904709fe-cc4f-4255-aaf6-522fbf4b7da6?s=SM"
